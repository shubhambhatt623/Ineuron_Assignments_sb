## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language? 

    -- general purpose:
        --> We call python As General programing Language as We can create different programs from python as it is not subjected for a specific domain .
    -- high-level programming language :
        -->  Python is high-level programming language as it is easy to understand and easy to interpret .

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

    Python called a dynamically typed language because the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.It doesnâ€™t know about the type of the variable until the code is run. So declaration is of no use.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

    --> pro:

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
    -String

Q8. What is type casting?

    - Converting a variable from One datatype to another . 

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
    
    -Yes . Using Loops or via .split method

Q10. What are keywords?

    -special reserved words that cant be use for any thing other than that work . 

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

    - We can by in future it can give us Errors .thus it is not recommended .

        break```
        
Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?

    Strings are immutable i.e once they are created they cannot be modified.
They are denoted by double quote .

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
    
    Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
    They are immutable  .

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?

    tuple_def = (1,2,3,4,5)

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

    Since tuple is immutable. we wont be able to add our name .

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?

    Two tuples cannot be appended but there are work arounds ..

    test_tup1 = (1, 3, 5)
    test_tup2 = (4, 6)

    print("The original tuple 1 : " + str(test_tup1))
    print("The original tuple 2 : " + str(test_tup2))
    res = test_tup1 + test_tup2
    print("The tuple after concatenation is : " + str(res))

Q45. What are sets in Python?

    A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. 


Q46. How can you create a set?

    var = {"this","is","Set"}

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.

    var.add("iNeuron")

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.

    we can add only 1 argument at a time .

Q49. How is update() different from add()?

    add() is intended for a single element , while . update() is for the introduction of other sets

Q50. What is clear() in sets?

    It is use to remove all variables from sets .

Q51. What is frozen set?

    Python frozenset() Method creates an immutable Set object from an iterable. It is a built-in Python function. As it is a set object therefore we cannot have duplicate values in the frozenset.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

     Python has two built-in types for sets: set and frozenset. A set is a mutable object while frozenset provides an immutable implementation.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.

    Union of two given sets is the set which contains all the elements of both the sets.    

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.

    Python set intersection() method returns a new set with an element that is common to all set defined.
    for instance :
        s1 = {1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
        s2 = {2, 3,7}
        print(s1.intersection(s2))
    
    o/p:- 2, 3,7

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?

    Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.

    Dictionary contains keys and values ,thus we can access elements via keys .

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

    By curly brackets we can delare a dictionary in Python .

Q58. What will the output of the following?
```

```
    Dictionary

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?

    sb = {1: {'name': 'John', 'age': '27', 'sex': 'Male'},
          2: {'name': 'Marie', 'age': '22', 'sex': 'Female'}}

    print(sb)

Q62. What is the use of get() function?

    The get() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.    

Q63. What is the use of items() function?

    The items() method returns a view object. The view object contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary, as tuples in a list.

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?

    The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller.

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?

    The popitem() method removes the item that was last inserted into the dictionary.

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?

    The keys() method returns a keys view object.

Q67. What is the use of values() function?

    The values() method returns a values object.

Q68. What are loops in Python?

    Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular condition is satisfied.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?

    There are two type of loop they are for loop and while loop .

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?

    The for and while loops are both conditional statements. A for loop is a single-line command that will be executed repeatedly. While loops can be single-lined or contain multiple commands for a single condition.     

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?

    The continue statement passes control to the next iteration .

Q72. What is the use of break statement?

    The purpose the break statement is to break out of a loop early.

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?

    The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code    

Q74. What is the use of range() function?

    The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 .

    Yes ,via for loop we can loop over a dictionary .
